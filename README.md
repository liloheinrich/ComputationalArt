# ComputationalArt
 Base repository for Mini Project 2: Computational Art

Run **recursive_art.py** to generate art.  

In the main function at the end of the file, the user can:
- run generate_art which will generate an image and function file based on the given parameters
- run generate_multi_art which will generate_art 'num_images' number of times, labeling the images sequentially
- run regenerate_art which will regenerate an image from a specified text file (unfortunately pretty slow)  

Currently, it creates three images and reproduces the middle one. Example run output included.  

User can override the default parameters or modify them at the top of the file. It may be useful to modify defaults and not specify overrides unless necessary when calling functions in main, making the program easier to use.
