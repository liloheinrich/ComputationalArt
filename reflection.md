Please prepare a short document (~1 paragraph to 1-2 pages) that addresses:

From a process point of view, what went well? What could you improve? Other possible reflection topics: Was your project appropriately scoped? Did you have a good plan for unit testing? How will you use what you learned going forward? What do you wish you knew before you started that would have helped you succeed?

What are your thoughts on “computational creativity”? Possible reflection topics for this: How creative do you believe you were in making your art? How do you think computational art differs from more traditional art? Who might deserve credit for the creation of your final piece of computational art?
